			<h3>Initiation</h3>
<pre><code>
var dgp = $('#digipay').digipay({
	// these functions event 
	// handlers can be changed
	'onSuccess':success,
	'onFail':failed,
	'onInitialize':init,
	'onNewPayment':newpay,
	//
})			
</code></pre>
			<h3>Making a new payment</h3>
<pre><code>
$('#newtx').on('click',function() {
	var namount = digibyte.Unit.fromBTC(
		parseFloat($('#amount').val())).toSatoshis() 
	);
	
	$('#digipay').digipay({
		amount:namount,
		address:$('#address').val()
	}).newPayment(makeid(10));
	// id is optional.
});			
</code></pre>	
			<h3>Introduction</h3>
			<p>
				This payment plugin makes it possible to accept DigiByte payments with only an internet connection. All you need is a public address and an amount. If you fill in an amount and address it will create an interface that will check if the payment has come through and it will redirect that payment to the specified address. This way the seller can check if the specified amount has been sent without the need to install a wallet on the device. Imagine being a seller with just a tablet or a smartphone. You sell your products and instead of accepting FIAT, you accept DigiByte. Because these payments require so little time, the transaction will be done within approximately 30 seconds on average. 
			</p>
			<h3>Why use this over a manual transaction method?</h3>
			<p>
				Because it doesn’t require a wallet to be synched to check the payment, you can accept payments redirected to a cold storage address. There is no need for the private key to be inserted into a hot wallet to check if payments have been done. You only need an internet connection. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Furthermore you don’t have to look at the screen of the buyer if the right amount of DigiByte have been sent. The script does this for you. Also this script will send an ID in the OP_RETURN value of the final payment which makes it easier to manage your sales. 
			</p>
		
			<h3>What are the downsides?</h3>
			<p>
				The downside is also an upside: It is all client side. This way you don’t need to set up an expensive server on which you have to rely in order to accept payments. You only need an internet connection. The risk is in a full client side payment method is in the buffer private and public key that are being stored in the GET values of the URI.
